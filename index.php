    <h1>Ashton API</h1>

    <p>
        Having an API in my own name might seem pretty narcissistic. However, I have three good reasons for doing so:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            It shows I can write an API.
        </li>
        <li>
            The API is genuinely useful for keeping my website up-to-date. An update to my LinkedIn or Twitter profile is automatically reflected here without having to perform the update in multiple locations.
        </li>
        <li>
            I now have a good codebase that I can copy across for future APIs, should the need arise. Interested in seeing the code? <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBAshton/ashton-api">It's on Github.</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        So, with my reasons justified, I invite you to <a href="docs/">read the API documentation</a>.
